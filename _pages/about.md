I'm a senior research scientist in Delivery Hero SE.

Previously, I held an assistant professor position in Distributed Systems at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.uoi.gr/?lang=en) of the University of Ioannina in Greece.
Prior to that I worked as a Postdoc researcher on scalable stream processing and data integration with Assis. Prof. [Asterios Katsifodimos](http://asterios.katsifodimos.com) at the [Web Information Systems](http://wis.ewi.tudelft.nl) group in [Delft University of Technology (TUDelft)](http://tudelft.nl).

I have a PhD in main memory data analytics from the Department of Management Science and Technology of the [Athens University of Economics and Business](http://aueb.gr) supervised by Prof. [Diomidis Spinellis](https://www.spinellis.gr). Before that I received an MSc with distinction in Computer Science from the Department of Computing of the [Imperial College London](http://imperial.ac.uk), and a BSc also from the Department of Management Science and Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business.

I have worked as a cloud software engineer at [GRNET](https://grnet.gr) and as a software engineer at [COSMOTE](https://www.cosmote.gr) where I built and operated big data workflows.
